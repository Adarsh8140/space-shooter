# 🚀 Amazon Q CLI Game Build Event - Alien Shooter Adventure

This project was created as part of the **Amazon Q CLI Game Build Challenge**, where developers use **Amazon Q CLI** to build games using just prompts and creativity — no manual coding initially required!

The idea is to explore the power of AI-assisted coding by building interactive games through natural language prompts and then refining the game further using custom code, assets, and enhancements.
